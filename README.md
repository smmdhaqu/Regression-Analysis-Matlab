# Regression-Analysis-Matlab
Tasks:	
• Developed two regression model functions to linearize complex equations and predict values for various materials using Data-driven approaches.
• Computed the coefficient of determination R^2 (R Square) to evaluate the predictive accuracy of both models for different materials.
• Derived specific fitting equations for three materials (100Cr6, C15, and C60) based on the model outputs.
• Compared the Performance of the two models, highlighting that Model-2 generally achieved better R^2 values but noted areas where Model-1 performed comparably.

Result:
• Found that R^2 values ranged from 0.4425 to 0.9082, with Model-2 yielding slightly better approximations overall, particularly for the material C60 with an R^2 = 0.9082, R^2 = 0.9082, R^2 = 0.9082.
